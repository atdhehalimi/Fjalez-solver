# Fjalez-solver
This is a Java program designed to help solving "fjalÃ«z", the Albanian version of the popular game Wordle. This program uses an algorithm based on Shannon's Entropy which helps to quantify the amount of information in a variable. At first, the program does not ask for input and the word selection is done automatically since it is the first word, the prediction is initially entirely based on the entropy algorithm since there are no conditions, and the result represents the most suitable word regarding the entire list, which does not change until the list does not change completely. Then an input is required that must be the same as the results given by the website, 5 numbers are written in the text space, which can be: zero, one, and two. Where the number zero indicates that the letter is not found, 1 that it is found in the wrong place, and 2 that the letter is in the correct place. At the moment the input is given, the program gives the prediction for the next word and asks for data on its results. The program is completed if you do not guess the word within 6 attempts or if the result is "22222" in which case the required word is also revealed.
